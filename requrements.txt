A user can have multiple orders, but each order belongs to a single user.

Each order can have multiple plants, and each plant can be a part of multiple orders. This many-to-many relationship is managed through the Order_Item table.

Each plant belongs to a category, allowing for easy categorization and search functionality based on plant types.
